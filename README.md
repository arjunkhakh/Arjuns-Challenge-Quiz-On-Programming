# Arjuns-Challenge-Quiz-On-Programming

In this gitHub website, A Quiz designed to challenge the user on Programming In Javascript! 

When you open the page you will come across a page with a button in the middle to start the quiz with a timer for how long you have to do the quiz. At the end of the quiz you will put down your initials which will be put onto the highscore list with your name and score.

This website was a very big challenge but has been left unfinished due to many, many debugging probelems that need to be sorted. Sadly on this occassion it was not done. :(
